// This is commented as extensively as I could manage!

tv_maxclients "10" // source tv max clients. you can set it to something reasonable in case you have a popular match happening and you don't want to have your server crash if you don't have a relay set up.

// tv_autorecord 0 // remove the two slashes at the very beginning of this line if you use a sourcemod plugin to autorecord stvs.

tv_name "TFCL SourceTV Bot" // STV name in scoreboard. change this if you want
hostname "TCFL Ultiduo Match" // server name in server browser. change this if you want
tv_title "TFCL Ultiduo Match (STV)" // server name in >stv< server browser. change this if you want
// tv_port "27020" // STV port, uncomment and change it if you need to

// sv_password "tfcl" // server password. uncomment and set to whatever you want to have a custom password only for competitive matches
// tv_password "tfclSTV" // STV password, uncomment to set an STV password so randoms cant join your STV without a password

sv_visiblemaxplayers "-1" // Set this to your max player limit on your server or things probably will break. Don't leave this at default if you can help it
